## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a
public issue.

Preferred reporting:
1. Use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository ("Report a vulnerability").
2. If advisories are unavailable, open a private issue with minimal details and
   request a secure follow-up channel.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide a timeline for a fix
once the issue is validated.
